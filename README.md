# Thanks for taking a look at the Pics of Pups App!

My history in frontend web development is primarily in Angular, but I'm really looking forward to giving React a shot and thought I'd start here.  See the Getting Started section to learn how to run the app.

## Getting Started with the Pics of Pups

### Clone the repo

### Run `npm start` from the project root (on master branch)

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
