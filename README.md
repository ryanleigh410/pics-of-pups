# Thanks for taking a look at the Pics of Pups App!

My history in frontend web development is primarily in Angular, but I'm really looking forward to giving React a shot and thought I'd start here.  See the Getting Started section to learn how to run the app.

I used the Material UI component library to display the pictures (I'm certainly not a designer, so please forgive the simplicity of the layout).  Clicking on a picture will display a modal with the selected image.  

## Getting Started with the Pics of Pups

### Clone the repo

### Run `npm start` from the project root directory (on master branch)

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
